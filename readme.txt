The solution that I came up with for this challenge aimed for the simplest
solution so as to avoid the need for the evaluator to install any new softwares
on their computer. This was also done to avoid any possible errors arising from
differences in existing software or operating systems.

In order to run this code challenge solution, open the index.html file with
any browser, though I recommend Chrome or Firefox.

Thank you,
